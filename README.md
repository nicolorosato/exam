## Implementation of a Database of European capitals


In this repository you can find a file named ```capitals.py``` that implements the ```check_capital``` and ```check_state``` functions. These functions check if the given input is a valid name of an European capital city, or state respectively. They are used in the ```main.py``` file to test if some cities and states are in Europe. If you run the program, executing the main file with: ```python main.py``` it will  give you the following possible results according to the two arguments you put after main.py. So for example: 

```
$ python main.py [argv1] [argv2]

The capital of Germany is Berlin

Sorry, Honduras does not seem to be an European state

The European state whose capital is Rome is Italy

Sorry, Tokyo is not the capital of any European state

```
